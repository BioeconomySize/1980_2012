This directory contains companion code for the paper "XXX".  The code will
reproduce the figures in the original paper which show the size, composition,
growth rate, and contribution to U.S. GDP of the bioeconomy from 1980-2012.

The code was written for the GNU Octave programming language with graphics
produced by gnuplot.  Testing was done with Octave 4.0.1 and gnuplot 5.0.1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Printing Plots
------------------------------------------------------------

From the command line, execute

octave GMDP_plots.m

OR

start Octave
at Octave command line, execute

GMDP_plots<RETURN>

This will produce three Scaled Vector Graphic files:

GMDP.svg
SectorGrowthRate.svg
GMDPfracGDP.svg

------------------------------------------------------------
Onscreen Display
------------------------------------------------------------

There are differences in the rendering for screen versus printing.
To display the plots onscreen, and potentially manipulate them further,
set the configuration variable 'do_print' to false.

Steps:

start Octave
do_print = false;<RETURN>
GMDP_PLOTS<RETURN>
